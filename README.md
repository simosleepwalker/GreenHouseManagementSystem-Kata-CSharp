# GreenHouseManagementSystem-Kata-CSharp Readme File

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a Green House Management System Kata implemented in C#. The project aims to demonstrate my experience with C# and my ability to design and implement a system that can manage the environmental conditions of a greenhouse.

## Description

The GreenHouseManagementSystem is a simple console application that simulates a greenhouse environment. The system includes sensor managers that can be run to provide the server with information about the humidity, light, and temperature of the greenhouse. The sensor managers collect data from various sensors placed in the greenhouse and send it to the server at regular intervals.

The server processes the data received from the sensor managers and uses it to control various devices in the greenhouse, such as fans, heaters, and watering systems, to maintain optimal environmental conditions for plant growth.
